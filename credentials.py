credentials: utilities for interacting with the user's keyring/keychain.

This is used by CasicsDB and other functions to retrieve user login & password
for the CASICS database, as well as host and port info for the database server.

# Credentials/keyring functions
# .............................................................................
# Explanation about the weird way this is done: the Python keyring module
# only offers a single function for setting a value; ostensibly, this is
# intended to store a password associated with an identifier.  However, we
# need to store several pieces of information, including a user name.  Since
# we don't know the user name ahead of time, we can't use that as a key to
# look up the credentials.  So, the approach here is to subvert the
# set_password() functionality to store the user name under the fake user
# "username", the password under the fake user "password", the host under the
# fake user "host", etc.
